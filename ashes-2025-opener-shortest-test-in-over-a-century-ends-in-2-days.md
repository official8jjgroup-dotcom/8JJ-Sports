The Ashes 2025 opener between Australia and England made history as one of the shortest Test matches in more than 100 years. Australia defeated England by eight wickets in just two days, marking the first Ashes Test to finish inside two days since 1921. Experts and fans alike have heavily criticized England's performance, highlighting the collapse of the much-hyped Bazball approach.

## 📜 Historic Shortest Ashes Test

This match became the sixth Ashes Test to finish inside two days, with the first four instances dating back to the 19th century:

- Lord's 1888
- The Oval 1888
- Manchester 1888
- The Oval 1890
- Nottingham 1921
- Perth 2025

With only 847 deliveries bowled, it was also the shortest Ashes Test in terms of balls since 1895, when Sydney saw 911 balls bowled for a result.

## 🏏 Australia's Dominance

Australia's batting and bowling performances were clinical. At the start of Day 2, Australia were 9/123 after Ben Stokes' five-wicket haul on Day 1 had restricted them. The hosts were bundled out for 132 in their first innings, leaving England with a 40-run lead.

### England's Batting Collapse

England had initially built a strong position, extending their lead to 105 runs with nine wickets remaining. However, the collapse came swiftly as they lost all remaining wickets in just 18.2 overs, adding only 99 more runs. This left Australia with a manageable target of 205.

## 🔥 Travis Head's Historic Knock

Australia's chase was anchored by Travis Head, who played one of the finest innings in Ashes history. Scoring 123 off just 83 deliveries, Head guided Australia to a comfortable eight-wicket victory, giving them a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.

### England's Bazball Approach Under Scrutiny

Despite the historic loss, England head coach Brendon McCullum defended the Bazball strategy, insisting the team will not abandon its aggressive approach. Nonetheless, critics argue that the collapse highlighted the risks of playing recklessly without consolidating innings on challenging pitches.

## 📊 Significance of the Ashes 2025 Opener

The Perth Test not only broke a 104-year record but also serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of tactical discipline in Test cricket. England's defeat shows that even an aggressive approach like Bazball can fail dramatically when not executed with control.

With Australia taking an early lead, the remaining matches in the series will be crucial for England to regroup and counter the hosts' dominant performance.
