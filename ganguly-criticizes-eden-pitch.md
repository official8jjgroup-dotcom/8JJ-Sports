## Ganguly Admits He Was Unhappy, Yet Complied

Ganguly, in his role as Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president, revealed that the Eden surface was deliberately kept dry for four days to meet explicit instructions from the Indian team management. The wicket turned out exactly as anticipated — low, slow, cracked, and unpredictable.  
Despite his concerns, Ganguly said he approved their request to avoid any friction with the BCCI.
