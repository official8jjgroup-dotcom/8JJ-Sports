The Bangladesh T20 World Cup 2026 matches are facing possible venue changes as the International Cricket Council (ICC) evaluates a request from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to relocate games originally scheduled in India. The request was made citing security concerns following the release of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman by the Kolkata Knight Riders during the IPL.
