## PSL Controversy Grows Over Silence Toward Multan Sultans

The controversy escalated when Tareen revealed that neither the PCB nor PSL management responded to multiple emails requesting the Multan Sultans’ valuation report and franchise renewal letter. While other teams reportedly received their documents, Multan’s exclusion has raised significant questions. According to Tareen, the lack of response for more than a month is unprecedented and deeply concerning.

## Multan Sultans’ Legal Action Threat Amid Communication Breakdown

Tareen confirmed that several formal communications — including a legal notice and a letter addressed to the PCB Chairman — have gone unanswered. This continued silence has prompted him to warn that **legal action** may be the franchise’s only remaining option if the “ghosting” persists. He described the situation as unnecessary and solvable through normal dialogue.

### Franchise Claims Repeated Neglect  
Other PSL franchise representatives have also expressed confusion over why Multan Sultans were excluded from the valuation cycle. The lack of transparency has fuelled frustration and public criticism, intensifying the PSL controversy.

## Background of the Dispute Between PCB and Multan Sultans

The current standoff follows an earlier conflict in which Tareen publicly criticised the PSL’s management structure. The PCB responded with a legal notice alleging a breach of franchise agreement. Tareen countered with a sarcastic public apology before tearing up the notice, signalling a serious breakdown in trust between the parties.

### Public Exchanges Reflect Deepening Tensions  
These heated interactions have brought internal PSL governance issues into the spotlight, revealing long-standing disagreements about operational transparency and franchise rights.

## PCB Moves Ahead With Expansion of PSL Franchises

Despite the controversy, the PCB is pushing forward with plans to **expand the PSL** by adding two new franchises for the next decade. Six cities — Hyderabad, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Muzaffarabad, Gilgit and Rawalpindi — have been proposed as options for potential new teams.

#### Expansion Raises New Questions About Franchise Valuation  
Current franchises, including Multan Sultans, want clarity on how expansion will impact valuation models and revenue-sharing structures. The communication blackout only increases frustration as long-term planning becomes more difficult.

## What Comes Next for Multan Sultans and PSL Governance?

If PCB and PSL officials continue avoiding engagement, the legal action hinted at by Tareen may soon become a reality — potentially overshadowing the league’s growth plans. Tareen maintains that transparent dialogue could resolve the issue quickly.

#### Call for Resolution and Improved Communication  
Tareen emphasises that better communication is essential for the league’s stability. Prolonged disputes could harm the PSL’s reputation and commercial relationships. The cricket community now awaits how the governing body responds as pressure mounts to repair the fractured relationship.
