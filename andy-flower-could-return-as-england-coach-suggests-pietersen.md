Andy Flower could potentially return as the head coach of the England cricket team, according to former player Kevin Pietersen. His comments came in the wake of England’s 4-1 defeat to Australia in the Ashes 2026 series.

Pietersen suggested that Flower’s experience and evolution as a coach could provide the guidance needed to rejuvenate England’s Test side, which struggled under current head coach Brendon McCullum.
