The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is at the center of an ICC T20 controversy after failing to overturn the Council’s decision to host Bangladesh’s men’s T20 World Cup matches in India. Despite multiple appeals citing player safety and government concerns, the ICC has stood firm.  

The BCB raised issues about logistics, security, and political tensions, even requesting neutral venues, but these efforts have been rejected. The ICC insists all safety measures are in place and sees no reason to change the schedule.
