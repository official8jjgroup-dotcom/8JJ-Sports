# NCCIA Opens Probe into Rashid Latif Over PCB Captaincy Criticism

Former Pakistan cricketer **Rashid Latif** is now under official investigation as the **National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA)** launches a probe into his recent remarks against the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and its chairman, **Mohsin Naqvi**. The inquiry focuses on Latif’s social media criticism regarding frequent captaincy changes and alleged links to betting companies.

## What Sparked the Investigation

The NCCIA initiated the probe after a complaint filed by a senior legal official at the PCB. The complaint accuses Latif of publicly criticising PCB leadership decisions, especially around the repeated replacement of team captains.  
Two separate inquiries — in **Islamabad** and **Lahore** — have been set up to evaluate the allegations, reflecting the seriousness of the matter.

## Latif’s Statements That Triggered Action

Latif took to social media to claim that the PCB was using a “divide and rule” approach by frequently changing captains.  
He also stated that Pakistan struggles to produce a “decent captain,” intensifying his criticism of the board’s leadership stability.

## Betting Allegations Added to the Inquiry

The investigation has reportedly broadened to include allegations related to **betting links**.  
Officials claim Latif named individuals connected with gambling companies but did not provide verifiable evidence.  
The NCCIA issued him a written questionnaire, but investigators say his responses have been incomplete so far.

## Latif’s Response and Legal Stakes

Latif has appeared before inquiry teams in both Islamabad and Lahore.  
However, law-enforcement officials indicate that if his claims are deemed “misleading or unsupported,” he may face action under Pakistan’s cybercrime laws.  
Investigators expect him to back up all allegations with concrete proof.

## Wider Implications for Cricket & Cyber-Regulation

This probe highlights how social media statements from former players can carry serious legal implications — especially when they challenge cricket institutions.  
The case also raises broader questions about **digital accountability**, **freedom of expression**, and the impact of online commentary on official governance structures.

## Other Figures Under the Scanner

The NCCIA reportedly also received a complaint involving **Wasim Akram**, alleging that he promoted a betting application.  
While no formal notice has been issued to him yet, the agency’s involvement indicates a stricter approach to policing digital misconduct within the cricket community.
