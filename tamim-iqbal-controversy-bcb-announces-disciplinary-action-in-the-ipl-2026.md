Tamim Iqbal has recently become the focus of a major controversy in Bangladesh cricket after BCB director M Nazmul Islam publicly referred to the former captain as an “Indian agent.”

The remark came in response to Tamim advocating for diplomatic dialogue between Bangladesh, the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) regarding the T20 World Cup 2026 venue issue. His stance has sparked strong reactions within the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), leading to discussions around disciplinary action.

Tensions have further escalated as Bangladesh remains reluctant to travel to India following Mustafizur Rahman being barred from participating in the IPL 2026. The situation has intensified scrutiny around governance, player relations, and diplomatic ties within international cricket.
